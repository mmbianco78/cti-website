# Session Log - CTI Website Final Merge

## Date: 2025-06-21

## Original Instructions

### Initial Request
"so I have the old version fo the code here in: /Users/marcobianco/code/claytargetinstruction/cti-astro/ and the newest draft version of the site in /Users/marcobianco/code/claytargetinstruction/cti-website/ - I want to take the "best" of the old styling and apply to new. I want to keep the structure of new, but also add the blog. I don't want the course details on new like we had on old (not the boxes, not the page, etc). I want to add an FAQ page to new. I need to rearrange / finalize the index on new and also the about and instructor pages, putting final content, images, etc. There are duplicate sections on new that can be merged better into final flow."

### Detailed Homepage Flow Instructions
"Final flow of new index i'm thinking is: Of course. That is the perfect question to ask now that all the pieces are on the table. Holistically reviewing the page flow is crucial.

First, let me say that your thought about swapping the video and the instructional infographic is an excellent and insightful idea. I fully agree with it.

Analysis of Your Suggestion
You are right that the current flow can be improved. Placing the instructional infographic directly under the "A New Era of Shooting Instruction" headline creates a powerful "show, don't just tell" moment. It immediately demonstrates your unique teaching technology right after you introduce the concept, which is much more effective.

Moving the promo video further down allows it to act as a final, high-energy piece of content to build excitement before the final call-to-action.

Recommended "Final" Page Flow
Based on your idea and a holistic review, here is the section-by-section order I recommend for the most persuasive user journey. This flow tells a compelling story from start to finish.

1. Hero Section
2. Meet Your Instructors Section
3. How It Works Section (Your New Idea) - with infographic
4. The CTI Advantage / Features Section (merged)
5. Testimonials Section
6. Promo Video Section (moved here)
7. Final CTA Section"

### Automation Requirements
"how can we go about doing this in the most automated and safest way possible? I can make a brand new branch on new, or we can do this merged "new new" version in a completely fresh directory. I also want to do this where I can completely step away, it's fully automated, and i don't have to press any keys to continue. I want to return in a few hours and it be completely done, self-checked (visually as well), and know that it's ready to rock, tested, mobile friendly, all best practices, etc."

### Important Platform Clarification
"Ok, and one more note, all CTAs on the new should be going to digital.claytargetinstruction.com (on the old codebase, i was trying to replace the course details, and speak to individual courses on the cti-astro site. In the new codebase we are *not* speaking to individual courses, bundles, etc. Keeping it much more simple about the platform, and instructors. Do not merge any of the individual or bundled course specific elements into the new, fully analyze both to make sure you have understanding of the different approaches here, and don't accidentally apply old approach to new site)."

### Autonomous Operation Confirmation
"Yes, create a new branch. After this are you able to operate autonomously and not ask me for permission to write files or necissary commands anymore so I can step away?"

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Branch Strategy**: Created new branch 'final-merge' for safe development
2. **No Course Details**: Avoided migrating any course-specific content, bundles, or pricing
3. **Platform Focus**: All CTAs point to digital.claytargetinstruction.com as the single destination
4. **Autonomous Operation**: Proceeded without asking for permission after initial confirmation

## Important Notes for Future Reference

### Platform Strategy Change
The old site (cti-astro) was trying to sell courses directly with detailed course pages, pricing, and bundles. The new site (cti-website) is purely a funnel to the digital platform, focusing on instructor credibility and the overall value proposition without specific course details.

### Content That Was NOT Migrated
- Course detail pages
- Pricing information
- Course bundles
- Chapter breakdowns
- Course-specific testimonials
- CourseCard components
- vlander directory components (course-specific)

### Placeholder Content Remaining
- Privacy Policy (needs real content)
- Terms of Service (needs real content)
- Aeonik font files (need to be added)
- Promo video files (need to be added)
- Social media meta images (should be created)

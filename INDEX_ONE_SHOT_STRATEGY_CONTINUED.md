# One-Shot Strategy (Continued)

## Conversion Insurance: Backup Elements

### If Video Production Is Delayed
**Alternative Hero**: Static but powerful
```
[Split Hero]
Left: Composite image of all 3 instructors with championships overlay
Right: Same copy structure

[Animation instead of video]
- Subtle number counter animating up to "36+"
- Testimonial quotes fading in/out
- Achievement badges appearing
```

### Fallback Social Proof Strategy
If testimonials are limited, use achievement-based proof:
```
"The Proof Is in the Championships"
- George: 31 World Championships (show medals/trophies)
- Anthony: Youngest Hall of Fame (show plaque)
- Zachary: 2024 World Champion (show recent win photo)

"Now Teaching Together for the First Time"
```

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Critical Mobile Adjustments:
1. **Hero simplifies to**:
   - Headline only (no subhead)
   - Single CTA button
   - Instructor badges below fold
   
2. **Video strategy**:
   - Thumbnail with play button (no autoplay)
   - Loads on demand only
   - Falls back to static image

3. **Testimonial ticker**:
   - Becomes static cards
   - Show 2-3 maximum
   - Swipeable carousel

4. **CTAs grow to**:
   - Full-width buttons
   - Larger tap targets (48px minimum)
   - Sticky bottom CTA after 50% scroll

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Content Risks & Solutions:

**Risk**: "Never taught before" might seem like false hype
**Solution**: Clarify immediately below:
```
"Online, together, with our patented teaching technology"
```

**Risk**: Beginners might still feel intimidated
**Solution**: Add reassurance micro-copy throughout:
```
- "Patient, step-by-step instruction"
- "Everyone starts somewhere"
- "No experience necessary"
```

**Risk**: Advanced shooters might think it's too basic
**Solution**: Include advanced proof points:
```
- "Master class insights"
- "Competition-winning mental game"
- "The 1% advantages that matter"
```

### Technical Risks & Solutions:

**Risk**: Slow page load kills conversions
**Solution**: Progressive enhancement
1. Text and CTA load instantly
2. Images load with blur-up effect
3. Video loads only on interaction
4. Testimonials load async after main content

**Risk**: Platform goes down during campaign
**Solution**: Backup messaging
```
"Due to overwhelming demand, we're expanding access.
Enter your email to be first when spots open:"

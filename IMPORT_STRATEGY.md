# Efficient Blog Import Strategy

## Overview
Instead of manually reading and processing hundreds of files through Claude, we use Python scripts to automate the entire import process. This reduces token usage by 99%+ and completes in minutes instead of hours.

## Prerequisites

Install required Python module:
```bash
pip install html2text
```

## The Approach

### 1. Test First (`test-import.py`)
```bash
python test-import.py
```
- Scans blog structure
- Counts posts, authors, categories
- Tests extraction on sample posts
- Validates our approach works

### 2. Full Import (`import-blog.py`)
```bash
python import-blog.py
```
- Processes all blog posts automatically
- Extracts metadata, content, images
- Converts HTML to Markdown
- Copies images to proper location
- Generates import summary

### 3. Review Results
- Check `import-summary.json` for overview
- Spot-check a few imported articles
- Fix any issues with specific posts

## Why This Is Efficient

**Traditional Approach** (via Claude):
- Read each HTML file: ~50 tokens per file
- Parse content: ~100 tokens per file
- Create markdown: ~50 tokens per file
- Copy images: ~20 tokens per file
- **Total**: ~220 tokens Ã— 50+ posts = **11,000+ tokens**

**Script Approach**:
- Write scripts: ~500 tokens
- Run scripts: 0 tokens
- Review results: ~200 tokens
- **Total**: ~700 tokens (93% reduction!)

## Next Steps

1. **Run test script** to validate approach:
   ```bash
   python test-import.py
   ```

2. **If test looks good, run full import**:
   ```bash
   python import-blog.py
   ```

3. **Review and clean up**:
   - Check import-summary.json
   - Test a few articles on the site
   - Fix any formatting issues

## Handling Comments

The script is designed to extract comments, but we can add this in a second phase if needed. The structure allows for:
- Storing comments as JSON files
- Adding comment display component later
- Preserving all comment metadata

## Error Handling

The script includes:
- Progress tracking (shows which post is being processed)
- Error catching (continues even if one post fails)
- Detailed summary (shows what succeeded/failed)
- Image fallbacks (handles missing images gracefully)

# Practice and Training: How to Improve Your Clay Target Shooting

One of the questions I'm asked most frequently is, "How should I practice to get better at clay target shooting?" Many shooters make the mistake of simply shooting round after round without a plan, hoping improvement will happen naturally. In this article, I'll share effective practice and training methods that will help you make the most of your time at the range.

## The Difference Between Practice and Training

First, let's clarify an important distinction:

**Practice**: Performing an activity repeatedly to improve or maintain skill level
**Training**: Focused work on specific aspects of performance with deliberate goals

Both are essential, but they serve different purposes in your development.

## Structured Practice Sessions

An effective practice session should include:

### 1. Warm-Up (15-20 targets)
- Start with easy, straightforward targets
- Focus on your pre-shot routine
- Pay attention to your fundamentals: stance, mount, and visual focus

### 2. Skill-Building (30-40 targets)
- Choose a specific skill to work on (e.g., maintaining gun speed, target focus)
- Create drills that isolate this skill
- Don't worry about hitting every target—focus on executing the process correctly

### 3. Simulation (Remaining targets)
- Shoot targets as you would in competition
- Maintain your pre-shot routine
- Track your results

## Effective Practice Techniques

### 1. Pre-Shot Routine
Develop and stick to a consistent pre-shot routine that includes:
- How you step into the stand
- Your preparation stance
- Your visual focus sequence
- Your mount and move to the target

Practice this routine until it becomes automatic.

### 2. Deliberate Practice
Rather than mindlessly shooting at targets, set specific goals for each session:
- Focus on specific types of targets you struggle with
- Work on maintaining consistent gun speed
- Practice your visual focus techniques

### 3. Solo vs. Group Practice
Both have their place:
- Solo practice allows for focused skill development
- Group practice simulates competition pressure
- Alternate between both types

## Technical Training Elements

### 1. Gun Mount Drills
Perform dry mount drills at home:
- 10-15 minutes daily of mounting your unloaded gun
- Focus on consistency and smoothness
- Use a mirror to check your mount position

### 2. Visual Focus Training
Practice these visual skills:
- Hard focus on the leading edge of the target
- Maintaining focus through the shot
- Quickly acquiring the target visually

### 3. Movement Training
Work on movement fundamentals:
- Consistent gun speed
- Smooth transitions between targets
- Body rotation and weight transfer

## Mental Training

The mental side is equally important:

### 1. Visualization
Spend time visualizing:
- Successful shots on challenging targets
- Your pre-shot routine
- Maintaining focus during pressure situations

### 2. Process vs. Outcome
Train yourself to focus on:
- Executing your process correctly
- Staying in the present moment
- Accepting the result after you've executed properly

### 3. Pressure Training
Create practice scenarios that simulate competition pressure:
- Shoot with others watching
- Create scoring scenarios where every shot matters
- Practice recovering from misses

## Training Schedule Example

For serious improvement, consider a schedule like:

**Monday**: Technical training (30-50 targets focusing on gun mount, movement)
**Wednesday**: Skill development (75 targets working on specific target presentations)
**Saturday**: Simulation (100 targets shot as in competition)

## Tracking Progress

Keep a practice journal that includes:
- Skills worked on
- Specific drills used
- Results and observations
- Areas for improvement

Review this journal regularly to identify patterns and track improvement.

## Conclusion

Effective practice isn't about how many targets you shoot, but how deliberately you work on your skills. By approaching your range time with clear goals, focusing on specific skills, and incorporating both technical and mental training, you'll see more rapid improvement than shooters who simply go through the motions.

Remember that every world champion started as a beginner. The difference between those who reach the top and those who plateau isn't talent—it's the quality of their practice and their commitment to continuous improvement.

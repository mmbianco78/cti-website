# CTI Website Launch & Optimization Plan

This document outlines the plan for deploying the completed CTI website and beginning the post-launch phase of monitoring, testing, and optimization.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch & Deployment

This phase focuses on the final steps required to get the site live.

1.  **Final Content Integration (User Task):**
    *   [ ] Replace all placeholder images with final, high-quality professional photos.

2.  **Pre-Launch Technical Tasks (Roo):**
    *   [ ] Integrate analytics provider (e.g., PostHog) to ensure all tracking events are captured.
    *   [ ] Configure 301 redirects from old URLs to preserve SEO value.

3.  **Production Deployment (Roo):**
    *   [ ] Deploy the completed site to the production environment on Netlify/Vercel once final content is in place.

## Phase 2: Post-Launch Monitoring & Optimization

This phase begins immediately after the site is live and focuses on data-driven improvements.

1.  **Establish Baseline Performance:**
    *   Monitor analytics for the first 1-2 weeks to establish baseline conversion rates for key funnels.

2.  **Begin A/B Testing:**
    *   Implement the A/B testing strategy outlined in `SIMPLE_TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   Prioritize high-impact tests, such as homepage hero copy and primary CTAs.

3.  **Continuous Improvement:**
    *   Use data from analytics and A/B tests to iteratively improve the site's performance against the success metrics defined in the `README.md`.

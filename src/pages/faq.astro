    question: 'How are these courses different from free YouTube videos?',
    answer: 'Our courses offer structured, comprehensive instruction directly from world champions using advanced on-screen graphics to show exactly where champions are looking and pointing. Unlike free content, our courses provide complete systems for improvement with lifetime access to updates and focused lessons that build on each other systematically.'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'Do I need to be an advanced shooter to benefit from these courses?',
    answer: 'Not at all. Our courses are designed for shooters of all skill levels. Beginners will establish proper fundamentals from the start while advanced shooters will discover refinements and mental techniques to break through scoring plateaus. Each instructor explains concepts clearly with demonstrations suitable for every experience level.'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'How long do I have access to the course materials?',

  },
  {
    id: '6',
    question: 'Which instructor\'s course should I choose?',
    answer: 'Each champion has a unique teaching style and approach to the sport. Anthony Matarese Jr. offers detailed technical breakdowns, George Digweed focuses on his pioneering swing-through technique, and Zachary Kienbaum provides exceptional guidance on reading targets and mental preparation. Many students benefit from learning multiple approaches.'

  },
  {
    id: '9',
    question: 'Can I download the videos for offline viewing?',
